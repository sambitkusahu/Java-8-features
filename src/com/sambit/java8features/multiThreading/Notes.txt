Join:
The Join method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another thread.
There are two types of threads.
    -> User Thread
    -> Daemon Thread
When we invoke the join() method, the calling thread goes into a waiting state. It remains in the waiting state until the referenced thread terminates.
The join method will keep waiting if the referenced thread is blocked which can become an issue as the calling thread will become non-responsive. Java provided two overloaded method that takes timeout period.
Join() throws InterruptedException if the reference thread is interrupted.
If the referenced thread unable to start or already terminated, join will return immediately.
    -> User Thread
    -> Daemon Thread

Threads created by user or developer is called user thread.
Daemon Threads are managed by JVM to take care of garbage collection.
